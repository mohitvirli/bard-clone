# Bard Clone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.6.

## Development server
Before running this locally. You'd need to set your OpenAI's API key in the project root in a new file called `.env`.
You can find the API key here - [Where do I find my API Key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key)

`.env` file should look like this
```
OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-xxxxxxxx'
```

After setting the API key, you can use `npm install` and do a `npm start` to navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Attaching some screenshots. The app is Mobile Responsive.
